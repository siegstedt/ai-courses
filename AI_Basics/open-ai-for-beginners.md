# Open AI for Beginners: Programmatic Prompting

**Description**: In this project you will programmatically prompt an OpenAI model using the OpenAI API, and utilize the AI to enrich data of an existing movie collection. You will use Python to prompt the davinci-003 OpenAI model based on JSON objects storing details of the user's movie collection. You will enrich the movie collection with data such as director, genre and year of release, as well as dynamically generating the movie plots, through the OpenAI model. You will also learn how to calibrate the model response using the temperature parameter. Learners in this project will create a dynamic AI-driven data enrichment and content generation system for a movie database web app.
